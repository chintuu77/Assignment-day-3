2) Moving files from one folder to another folder.

step 1) make a new Directory using command -> mkdir dir_name. Ex: vivek/

step 2) Create text files with content and save it. Ex: abc.txt

step 3) now come to home directory using command -->  cd .. or cd ../..   

step 4) make another new directory which we need to move files from earlier directory. --> mkdir pavan/

step 5) now i need to move file vivek dir to pavan dir, follow steps:
$ cd ../
$ mv -t Filename Dirname . ie; ( $ mv -t abc.txt pavan).

step 6) Now the file from vivek folder to pavan is moved.
